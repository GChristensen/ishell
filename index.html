    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">iShell is a browser add-on available by the Ctrl+Space key
        combination that lets you give commands to a browser by entering text into a special
        input box. Commands are shortcuts for things that you commonly do on the Web; they can
        eliminate repetitive tasks and let you get more done, faster. You can instantly obtain
        interactive results of command execution in the same window. It is possible create your
        own iShell commands in JavaScript.</p>

    <p>The complete list of the builtin commands is available <a href="docs/commands.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Create your own commands</h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        iShell allows to declaratively define and automatically parse commands with
        prepositional arguments. For example, consider the command <b>show-text</b> with the
        following syntax: "<b>show-text</b> <i>text</i> <b>in</b> <i>popup</i>". It has the
        prepositional argument named <b>in</b> and the nameless first argument. iShell
        command parser will automatically provide values (<i>text</i>, <i>popup</i>) of the
        arguments to the command implementation <a
            href="https://github.com/GChristensen/ishell#modern-class-based-command-syntax"
            target="_blank">handler methods</a> after you enter the command in the input box.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        iShell commands also have full access to jQuery and browser WebExtension APIs, which
        give you the ability to extend the browser almost effortlessly. Find more information on command
        authoring in the <a
            href="https://gchristensen.github.io/ishell/addon/ui/options/tutorial.html"
            target="_blank">tutorial</a> at iShell setting pages.
    </p>

    <h4>History</h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        iShell is a WebExtensions revival of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity"
                                                target="_blank">Mozilla Ubiquity</a>. It aims to
        bring back the full functionality of Ubiquity to Firefox Quantum and provide a clean,
        unified modern object-oriented command authoring API.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        The original Ubiquity was an experiment in linguistic ubiquitous user
        interfaces. Such interfaces are driven by natural-language commands and
        could be instantly accessed anywhere. The legacy Ubiquity also had a
        command subscription model, where you were supposed to subscribe to
        third-party commands that were updated automatically. For security
        reasons, there is no such model in iShell. You need to manually maintain
        third-party code in the iShell command editor by using the
        <b>install</b> command.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        Despite that, iShell is still immensely useful if you can write
        JavaScript to automate things you have (web)APIs for or to extend the
        browser functionality without much effort. With the standard CSS and HTML,
        the addon allows to create interactive presentations of any complexity.
    </p>

    <h4>Some additional features not found in the original Ubiquity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Modern class-based command syntax.</li>
        <li>More argument roles (prepositions): 'by' (cause), 'for' (subject) and 'on'
            (dependency).
        </li>
        <li>Ability to scroll through preview list items with Ctrl+UP/DOWN keys.</li>
        <li>It is possible to separate user commands into multiple categories in the command
            editor.
        </li>
        <li>Ability to add commands to the browser context menu.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>API keys are necessary for some built-in commands</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some built-in commands now require API keys of their
        corresponding services. If the help links at the iShell interface provide not
        enough guidance to obtain them, please see the project <a
