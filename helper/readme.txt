Installation on Linux:

1. Make sure that Python 3.7+ is your default Python implementation.
2. In su shell use "pip install ." command from this directory
   (without quotes) to install the ishell_helper script.
3. Copy ".mozilla" folder to your home directory, change the "path"
   property in the JSON manifest if necessary. The exact location of the
   script may be revealed by the "pip uninstall ishell_helper" command.
   NOTE: a full absolute path is required.
